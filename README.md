## Introduction
UCOB (Unbounded-thread COverability analysis for Boolean programs) implements the approach presented in the following paper:

>   Peizun Liu and Thomas Wahl, [Infinite-State Backward Exploration of Boolean Broadcast Programs](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/hunt/FMCAD/FMCAD14/proceedings/26_liu.pdf). In FMCAD, pp.155-162, 2014.


## Download
##### Source Code
* Is here on [github](https://github.com/lpzun/ucob).


## Installation
##### 1. Dependencies
UCOB depends the API [IJIT](https://github.com/lpzun/ijit). To run UCOB, you first need to install IJIT. Please refer to more details in the [IJIT](https://github.com/lpzun/ijit) repository.  

##### 2. Install from resource
>     git clone the github repository
>     make

##### 3. Dynamically Loading IJIT

###### Linux
>     LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/your/path/lib
>     export LD_LIBRARY_PATH

###### MAC OSX
>     DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH=/your/path/lib/
>     export DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH

## Usage
For instructions on how to use UCOB, run the tool as follows:
>     ucob -h

##### Boolean programs

The Boolean programs UCOB takes have different label format (only numbers) from the ones generated by SATABS. Download the front end [here](https://github.com/lpzun/ucob/tree/master/front) to perform the translation -- more usage details can be found in the README file.
